# Password Manager Application

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to create a password management system and web application, similar to that of LastPass or Bitwarden. Users will be able to generate secure passwords, store passwords and account information in a database that is viewable via a web app, and stored information can then be automatically filled into website forms across the internet.

## Running the site

- First make sure that [https://nodejs.org/en/](node.js) is installed

- Run "npm install" in the root directory
  - And in the backend directory

- Add the link to the database in index.js

## Running the backend

- Make sure that your current directory is "backend"

- Run "node index.js"

## Running the frontend

- Make sure that your current directory is root

- Run "npm start"

- Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the site should be viewable.
